                The Taj Mahal, which was constructed in 1632 by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, had been initially named 'Roza-e-Munavvara' which means Unique Building, but was then renamed by Shah Jahan as Taj Mahal as a loving tribute to his wife for whom his love surpassed all belief. Shah Jahan was very upset about the death of his wife, hence spent years creating the most beautiful site. In 1666, Shah Jahan died and was buried next to his wife inside the tomb of the Taj Mahal.
